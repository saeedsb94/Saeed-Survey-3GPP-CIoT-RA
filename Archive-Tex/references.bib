 abstract = {Fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication technology is now widely available in several countries, with millions of 5G customers. Therefore, it's time for academia and business to focus on the next generation. This paper will overview the sixth-generation (6G) mobile network, including motivations, use case scenarios, requirements, supported research projects, and technologies. We discuss the Beyond 5G (B5G) evolution and advanced 5G features to predict the critical 6G requirements and highlight the 6G capabilities. We also introduce the 6G scenarios, requirements, and technological components compared to 5G. Moreover, the current status of 6G research is discussed, and a rough roadmap for specification and regulation is explored. Then we describe a few prospective applications, their benefits, concepts, and research directions. We explore the business direction for 6G by introducing the most recently 6G projects in the vertical markets. We also propose a network architectural vision and the evolution of hardware-software designs to satisfy the higher requirements of 6G applications. This paper also presents a comprehensive survey of existing 6G trends, technologies, applications, industrial markets, and network structures for the most promising 6G applications.},

 abstract = {Recently, wireless technologies have been growing actively all around the world. In the context of wireless technology, fifth-generation (5G) technology has become a most challenging and interesting topic in wireless research. This article provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G wireless systems. IoT in the 5G system will be a game changer in the future generation. It will open a door for new wireless architecture and smart services. Recent cellular network LTE (4G) will not be sufficient and efficient to meet the demands of multiple device connectivity and high data rate, more bandwidth, low-latency quality of service (QoS), and low interference. To address these challenges, we consider 5G as the most promising technology. We provide a detailed overview of challenges and vision of various communication industries in 5G IoT systems. The different layers in 5G IoT systems are discussed in detail. This article provides a comprehensive review on emerging and enabling technologies related to the 5G system that enables IoT. We consider the technology drivers for 5G wireless technology, such as 5G new radio (NR), multiple-input-multiple-output antenna with the beamformation technology, mm-wave commutation technology, heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the role of augmented reality (AR) in IoT, which are discussed in detail. We also provide a review on low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), security challenges, and its control measure in the 5G IoT scenario. This article introduces the role of AR in the 5G IoT scenario. This article also discusses the research gaps and future directions. The focus is also on application areas of IoT in 5G systems. We, therefore, outline some of the important research directions in 5G IoT.},

 abstract = {The new 5G Reduced Capability (RedCap) protocol offers up to 88x and 528x higher data rates and dynamic pilot placements compared to previous Cat-M and NB-IoT standards, respectively. This leads to high application variability of IoT devices and therefore poses a challenge for the implementation of channel estimation (CE), especially under weak radio signal conditions. However, due to the computational complexity of optimal methods, practical suboptimal approaches with denoising capability are preferred in low-power devices. This work investigates the performance and implementation aspects of practical IoT CE denoising techniques on a vector digital signal processor (vDSP). This solution enables adaptation to the new IoT workload requirements with a 15.9x speed-up compared to the non-vectorised approach at 99.2\% processor efficiency. In addition, for the purpose of solution adaptation to various IoT standards, the clock frequency requirements for the complete channel estimation chain are analysed with respect to different processor configurations.},

 abstract = {The new 5G Reduced Capability (RedCap) protocol offers up to 88x and 528x higher data rates and dynamic pilot placements compared to previous Cat-M and NB-IoT standards, respectively. This leads to high application variability of IoT devices and therefore poses a challenge for the implementation of channel estimation (CE), especially under weak radio signal conditions. However, due to the computational complexity of optimal methods, practical suboptimal approaches with denoising capability are preferred in low-power devices. This work investigates the performance and implementation aspects of practical IoT CE denoising techniques on a vector digital signal processor (vDSP). This solution enables adaptation to the new IoT workload requirements with a 15.9x speed-up compared to the non-vectorised approach at 99.2\% processor efficiency. In addition, for the purpose of solution adaptation to various IoT standards, the clock frequency requirements for the complete channel estimation chain are analysed with respect to different processor configurations.},

We expect to see the number of IoT connected devices explosively grows and will reach hundreds of billions during the next few years. To support such a massive connectivity, various wireless technologies are investigated. In this survey, we provide a broad view of the existing wireless IoT connectivity technologies and discuss several new emerging technologies and solutions that can be effectively used to enable massive connectivity for IoT. In particular, we categorize the existing wireless IoT connectivity technologies based on coverage range and review diverse types of connectivity technologies with different specifications. We also point out key technical challenges of the existing connectivity technologies for enabling massive IoT connectivity. To address the challenges, we further review and discuss some examples of promising technologies such as compressive sensing (CS) random access, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and massive multiple input multiple output (mMIMO) based random access that could be employed in future standards for supporting IoT connectivity. Finally, a classification of IoT applications is considered in terms of various service requirements. For each group of classified applications, we outline its suitable IoT connectivity options.},

 abstract = {Energy efficiency is critical for future sustainable cellular systems. Power saving optimization has been a key part of the fifth generation (5G) new radio specifications. For 5G-advanced and future 6G, with the anticipation of a trillion internet of things (IoTs) devices with non-rechargeable or low-density batteries, device power efficiency is rather essential. There are numerous contributions from industry and academia which present the potential power saving gains of the various 5G power saving techniques; however, there is a lack of art on the performance cost paid to achieve such power saving gains. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the radio latency and reliability cost, which is lost due to a certain 5G new radio power saving feature. A thorough review of the state-of-the-art 5G power saving techniques is introduced. Extensive system level simulations are performed to evaluate the latency and reliability cost of the considered power saving features. The paper offers valuable recommendations for supporting power-efficient latency-critical traffic for beyond 5G-advanced systems.},

We evaluate their performance in terms of packet delay, UE power consumption, signaling overhead and physical resource efficiency. Results show that all SDT solutions bring attractive gains as compared to the conventional data transfer after the RRC connection resume. Particularly, CG-based SDT solution achieves the highest gains with 73\% in UE power efficiency and 85\% in latency reduction. It enables to reduce the signaling overhead and to save the physical resource usage by 78\%.

@article{migabo_narrowband_2020,
 abstract = {The Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has been introduced in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Rel-13 with the aim to provide low-cost, low-power, wide-area cellular connectivity for the Internet of Things. With the exponentially increasing number of connected wireless devices in the order of 100 billion, it has become crucial that researchers develop efficient resource management techniques to meet the 5th Generation (5G) quality of service (QoS) requirements. Recently, several research challenges including the low modulation data rates, energy-expensive channel coding techniques, and the fast-growing number of connected devices have been identified as some of the main issues encountered in the design and deployment of NB-IoT systems. In addition, several techniques have emerged in the literature to resolve some of these challenges of NB-IoT systems. However, the research activities towards the enhancement of the NB-IoT resource management are yet to continue in the next half-decade before, high data rates, energy-efficient, and scalable NB-IoT specifications can be released for the standardisation and commercialisation. Considering the limited number of existing surveys of such technical enhancement approaches in a broader perspective (i.e. energy efficiency, data rate performance and scalability) and also the non-existence, to the best of our knowledge, of a comparative survey, this paper seeks to elaborate, describe and compare the performances of such resources management approaches. Of the multiple NB-IoT resources, the focus of this paper is on the data rate, energy efficiency, and scalability enhancement schemes that have been proposed for the last three years. The contribution of the paper lies in the analysis, synthesis, comparison and summarised alignments of some of the major existing schemes towards identifying challenges faced by the NB-IoT development. Finally, this work seeks to identify research challenges, open questions, and opportunities that could arise from the existing techniques analysed.},

 abstract = {5th generation (5G) systems have been designed with three main objectives in mind: increasing throughput, reducing latency, and enabling reliable communications. To meet these (often conflicting) constraints, in 2019 the 3GPP released a set of specifications for 5G NR, one of the main innovations being the support for communications in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. However, how to implement lower complexity, energy efficient, mid-market Internet of Things (IoT) applications is still an on-going investigation, currently led by the 3GPP which is extending the NR standard with NR-Light specifications to support devices with reduced capabilities (REDCAP). In this paper we investigate the feasibility of operating such devices at mmWaves, in view of the requirements and expectations for NR- Light applications in terms of cost and complexity, throughput, and latency. Contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we il- lustrate the potential of mmWave communication for mid-market IoT use cases. Then, we highlight and motivate the design of an NR-Light candidate interface derived from NR by a selection of features. Finally, we demonstrate the technical soundness of this interface in an industrial IoT setup via simulations.},

 abstract = {The support for Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved over several successive releases of standard specifications in 3GPP. As a result, eMTC and NB-IoT are mature 4G wireless technologies that are seeing largescale deployment. Thus, even as 4G systems migrate to 5G New Radio (NR) technology, there is a strong motivation to continue to support eMTC devices through efficient deployment of eMTC within a 5G NR carrier. In 3GPP, studies are underway to identify and rectify issues related to coexistence between eMTC and NR systems. This paper presents an analysis of such coexistence considering various aspects. The analysis demonstrates that the issues affecting coexistence can generally be handled through implementation. The paper also discusses several mechanisms for achieving improved performance with coexistence.},

 abstract = {Industrial digital transformation through efficient automation hinges largely on the deployment of communication infrastructures that meet the requirements of smart factory use cases. These infrastructures involve multiple devices that utilize different communication technologies to increase the overall operational efficiency. Rooting from the key implementation requirements of a smart factory environment, this article focuses on the role of cellular connectivity and wearable technology in enabling new industrial applications. Specifically, we shed light on a novel category of services - industrial mid-end wearable applications - by positioning their requirements among the 5G service classes. We then identify features that can complement cellular connectivity to further support the given requirements. More precisely, we review cellu-lar-network-aided device-to-device communications and reduced-capability devices. Our performance evaluation results justify the choice of these features and show that they can work in concert with cellular connectivity to enhance spectral efficiency and reliability in industrial mid-end wearable applications.},

Smart factories rely primarily on wireless connectivity provided by new radio (NR) systems to meet the stringent requirements of industrial applications. Among these, several industrial wearable and sensor-based services involve devices with relaxed communication capabilities as compared to Rel-15 NR user equipment. Hence, a new category of reduced-capability (RedCap) devices becomes essential in industrial private networks. As RedCap devices may experience degradation of uplink (UL) performance due to simplifications in radio frequency and baseband capabilities, this paper focuses on enhancing NR RedCap operations with existing 5G solutions for UL improvement, namely, dual connectivity, carrier aggregation, and supplementary UL. Specifically, we discuss these options for RedCap wearable devices and evaluate the performance gains of the selected technology using link-level simulations.},

This work presents a simulation analysis of RRM relaxation for reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR) UEs. Two categories are simulated, namely ‘low mobility’ and ‘low mobility + not at the cell edge’ to find the most suitable relaxation criteria for the RRC-Connected state. This work quantifies the energy savings that RRM relaxation brings for stationary and low mobility RedCap UEs with different relaxation intervals varied from 40 ms to 5120 ms. Furthermore, it identifies the cost of energy-saving in terms of radio link failures and handover failures. The simulation analysis shows that the ‘low mobility + not at the cell edge’ criteria is the most suitable for RedCap UEs in comparison to only ‘low mobility’ criteria. Also, high relaxation interval (i.e. 5120 ms) is suitable up to pedestrian UEs speeds.},

 abstract = {The next wave of wireless technologies is proliferating in connecting things among themselves as well as to humans. In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of sensors, machines, vehicles, drones, and robots will be connected, making the world around us smarter. The IoT will encompass devices that must wirelessly communicate a diverse set of data gathered from the environment for myriad new applications. The ultimate goal is to extract insights from this data and develop solutions that improve quality of life and generate new revenue. Providing large-scale, long-lasting, reliable, and near real-time connectivity is the major challenge in enabling a smart connected world. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on existing and emerging communication solutions for serving IoT applications in the context of cellular, wide-area, as well as non-terrestrial networks. Specifically, wireless technology enhancements for providing IoT access in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, and communication networks over the unlicensed spectrum are presented. Aligned with the main key performance indicators of 5G and beyond 5G networks, we investigate solutions and standards that enable energy efficiency, reliability, low latency, and scalability (connection density) of current and future IoT networks. The solutions include grant-free access and channel coding for short-packet communications, non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence. Further, a vision of new paradigm shifts in communication networks in the 2030s is provided, and the integration of the associated new technologies like artificial intelligence, non-terrestrial networks, and new spectra is elaborated. In particular, the potential of using emerging deep learning and federated learning techniques for enhancing the efficiency and security of IoT communication are discussed, and their promises and challenges are introduced. Finally, future research directions toward beyond 5G IoT networks are pointed out.},

To meet such contrasting requirements, 5G networks rely on its new radio interface (5G-NR) to address eMBB and URLLC services and on LTE-M and NB-IoT for mMTC services. As of Release 16, 5G networks effectively support the extreme ends of key performance indicators, namely bandwidth, reliability, latency, coverage, and autonomy. This article analyzes the gap between those capabilities and the requirements of use cases as discussed in the NR-REDCAP 3GPP Study Item of Release 17: video surveillance, industrial IoT, and wearables, to name a few. This article further discusses the challenges driving the design of this new air interface for reduced-capability 5G devices in the sub-6 GHz band and key enablers to fulfill those use case requirements.},

Meanwhile, there are several key use cases, such as industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance, and wearables, whose requirements fall in-between those of eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC. In this regard, 5G can be further optimized to efficiently support such mid-range use cases. Therefore, in Release 17, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) developed the essential features to support a new device type enabling reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR) devices aiming at lower cost/complexity, smaller physical size, and longer battery life compared to regular 5G NR devices. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of 3GPP Release 17 Red-Cap while describing newly introduced features, cost reduction and power saving gains, and performance and coexistence impacts. Moreover, we present key design guidelines, fundamental tradeoffs, and future outlook for RedCap evolution.},

 abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) wireless technology is primarily developed to support three classes of use cases, namely, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine-type communication (mMTC), with significantly different requirements in terms of data rate, latency, connection density, and power consumption. Meanwhile, there are several key use cases, such as industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance, and wearables, whose requirements fall in-between those of eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC. In this regard, 5G can be further optimized to efficiently support such mid-range use cases. Therefore, in Release 17, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) developed the essential features to support a new device type enabling reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR) devices aiming at lower cost/complexity, smaller physical size, and longer battery life compared to regular 5G NR devices. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of 3GPP Release 17 Red-Cap while describing newly introduced features, cost reduction and power saving gains, and performance and coexistence impacts. Moreover, we present key design guidelines, fundamental tradeoffs, and future outlook for RedCap evolution.},

 abstract = {A Case Report Form (CRF) is a questionnaire mostly used in clinical trial research to collect patients’ information. Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) is taking the place of the normal paper CRF due to its digital convenience. An eCRF is a feature of an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system and it collects users’ information, which might be sensitive. This research aims to find appropriate EDC systems for the Personal Health Train (PHT). This platform enables organizations and researchers to work with health data from diverse sources without sharing these data. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the system is prepared for privacy and security regulations. Due to the diversity of privacy regulations worldwide, this research investigates whether the EDC systems comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This paper presents a short review of the PHT concept, the role of the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, potential risks, protection measures for hospital information systems. In our evaluation, we provided an overview of five EDC systems: Castor, OpenClinica, REDCap, NowEDC, and ShareCRF. We evaluated their security and privacy features and techniques to store data. A comparison of their features is given, and a preliminary usability test is presented.},

 abstract = {Low power and long range machine-to-machine (M2M) communication techniques are expected to provide ubiquitous connections for the wireless devices. In this paper, three major low power and long range M2M solutions are surveyed. The first type of solutions is referred to as the low power wide area (LPWA) network. The design of the LPWA techniques features low cost, low data rate, long communication range, and low power consumption. The second type of solutions is the IEEE 802.IIah which features higher data rates using a wider bandwidth than the LPWA-based solutions. The third type of solutions is operated under the cellular network infrastructure. Based on the analysis of the pros and cons of the enabling technologies of the surveyed M2M solutions, as well as the corresponding deployment strategies, the gaps in knowledge are identified. The paper also presents a summary of the research directions for improving the performance of the surveyed low power and long range M2M communication technologies.},

@article{zhou_analyzing_2022_4,
 abstract = {Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) does not support data transmission during random access (RA) procedures, which results in unnecessary control signalling overhead and power consumption, especially for small data transmission (SDT). Motivated by this, 3GPP has proposed 4/2-step SDT RA schemes based on the existing grant-based (4-step) and grant-free (2-step) RA schemes, with the aim to enable data transmission during RA procedures in Radio Resource Control (RRC) Inactive state. To compare the 4/2-step SDT RA schemes with the benchmark 4/2-step RA schemes, we provide a spatio-temporal analytical framework to evaluate the RA schemes, which jointly models the preamble detection, Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) decoding, and data transmission procedures. Based on this analytical model, we derive the analytical expressions for the overall packet transmission success probability and average throughput in each RACH attempt. We also derive the average energy consumption in each RACH attempt. Our results show that 2-step SDT RA scheme provides the highest overall packet transmission success probability, and the lowest average energy consumption, but the performance gain decreases with the increase of device intensity.},
