	abstract = {5th generation (5G) systems have been designed with three main objectives in mind: increasing throughput, reducing latency, and enabling reliable communications. To meet these (often conflicting) constraints, the 3GPP released a set of specifications for 5G NR, one of the main innovations being the support for communications in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. However, how to implement lower complexity, energy efficient, mid-market Internet of Things (IoT) applications is still an on-going investigation, currently led by the 3GPP which is extending the NR standard with NR-Light specifications to support devices with reduced capabilities (REDCAP). While REDCAP devices may also operate at mmWaves to improve the network performance, hardware/software simplifications are needed to support balanced and mixed requirements compared to 5G NR systems. In this context, the contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we present some NR-Light use cases for which the support of the mmWave bands is desirable. Second, we describe how 5G NR can be simplified to achieve NR-Light requirements and expectations. Finally, we evaluate via simulation the performance of NR-Light devices operating at mmWaves in an industrial IoT setup, in terms of cost and complexity, throughput, and latency.},

To efficiently serve some other use cases whose requirements lie in-between these main use cases, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), in Rel-17, introduce support for the reduced capability new radio (NR) devices known as RedCap with lower cost and complexity compared to legacy 5G devices. The considered complexity reduction techniques are associated with degraded link performance and coverage for the physical channels. Particularly, for the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), which requires careful consideration, the reduction of the user equipments’ (UEs) complexity and the associated coverage loss can lead to an increase in the PDCCH blocking probability. This, in turn, can impact either the latency or the network capacity depending on the scenario. In this paper, we investigate the PDCCH blocking probability metric for RedCap devices. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of blocking probability in terms of various parameters including the number of users, size of downlink control information, size of control resource set, and the number of PDCCH candidates. Our results demonstrate that the PDCCH blocking probability increases by reducing the number of antenna branches, the number of PDCCH candidates, control resource set, and by increasing the number of scheduled UEs. We also show that the impact of reducing the DCI size is marginal on the PDCCH blocking probability. Finally, we discuss potential solutions and design guidelines for reducing the PDCCH blocking probability.},

	abstract = {Recently, a new type of device that enables reduced capability (RedCap) has been identified and standardized in the fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR). Because RedCap user equipment (UE) is designed to have low device cost and complexity compared with high-end devices, single-layer transmission is mainly considered for RedCap UE. For single-layer transmission, traditional eigenmode beamforming, which transmits a data stream through the maximum eigenmode direction, is applicable for base stations (BSs), and a simple matched filter can be used on the UE side. Under this operation scenario, the performance of eigenmode beamforming is analyzed in this study, and the effect of the number of UE antennas on the achievable rate is investigated. The asymptotic achievable rate for eigenmode beamforming with practical channel training for both the uplink and downlink is derived as a closed-form expression for any number of UE antennas n . For the analysis, the statistics of the maximum eigenvalue are derived using the Tracy-Widom distribution. The results of the analysis show that the maximum eigenvalue is a concave function in terms of n , and there is an optimal number of UE antennas n\_{\textbackslash}mathrm opt that maximizes the achievable rate. Simulations verify the analytical results and show that n\_{\textbackslash}mathrm opt maximizing the achievable rate decreases as the numbers of BS antennas and co-scheduled UEs increase.},

	abstract = {Recently, Reduced Capability (RedCap) New Radio (NR) User Equipment (UE), which has smaller cost, lower complexity, and longer battery life than normal NR UE, was introduced by 3GPP in R17. In particular, the UE energy consumption is an important metric of interest. Small Data Transmission (SDT) technology has been proposed by 3GPP to save UE power, which allows UEs to directly transmit small-sized uplink payloads in Inactive state without transitioning to Connected state. However, for a large number of RedCap UEs with bursty traffic, how to minimize UE energy consumption while ensuring the reliability of uplink payload transmission is still a challenge. Towards this end, we propose a novel Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-enhanced SDT scheme to tackle this challenge. Considering that the power level pool is an important component of NOMA to achieve performance gains and the power level pool design problem in multi-cell scenarios is still rarely studied, we present a Multi-Agent Dueling Double Deep Q Network (MAD3QN)-based algorithm to further improve the performances of the proposed scheme by optimizing the power level pool for each gNB with practical imperfect Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). Extensive numerical comparisons among the proposed scheme and multiple benchmarks show that the proposed scheme (with appropriate user pairing) can significantly improve the transmission reliability of large-scale RedCap UEs with a small cost of energy consumption.},

	abstract = {The paging functionality in New Radio release 15 can be energy consuming, especially if a UE is rarely paged or its Paging Occasion (PO) suffers from a high false paging alarm rate. Therefore, paging enhancements for UE power saving are being developed in New Radio release 17. In this work, the concept of Early Paging Indication (EPI), where a UE is notified in advance of its PO whether the UE has to monitor the PO, is examined. As a result, the UE can skip the time-frequency synchronization phase prior to a PO, if the UE need not monitor the PO. The EPI can be signaled via a Downlink Control Information (DCI) message carried in the Physical Downlink Control Channel or via a Reference Signal, e.g. the Secondary Synchronization Signal. Furthermore, the EPI may carry sub-grouping information to divide the UEs, sharing the same PO, into sub-groups, resulting in lower group paging rate and fewer false paging alarms.Simulation results show the EPI can lead to 17 \%-34 \% energy savings as compared to the release 15 basic paging procedure, depending on the UE SINR radio conditions. If the EPI is complemented with sub-group information an additional 10 \% energy can be saved, while also mitigating the impact of high group paging rates. The DCI-based EPI can flexibly contain the sub-group indication, and potentially also Short Message and other information, and is therefore the preferred option.},

	abstract = {The 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless technology provides high data rates and improved latency to the end users. Such improvement is obtained from the advanced MAC and PHY layer techniques, which exhaust the battery life of the User Equipment (UE) quickly. To save the power of UE, 3GPP LTE proposes a mechanism called Discontinuous Reception Mechanism (DRX) which lets the UE switch its RF module off when data needs not be transmitted. In this paper, we have developed an analytical model to derive the DRX power saving obtained by the UE in LTE system. Different from other work, the RRC (Radio Resource Control) states transition is considered. The time period for power saving operation is divided into several independent parts to derive the power consumption and the transmission delay. In addition, we introduce the real power consumption model into the derived power saving model to obtain the truly power consumption. The analytical results show the UE with lower packet arrival rate can effectively save more power when entering RRC\_IDLE state, and there is a trade-off between the power consumption and the transmission delay.},

Despite 5G's vision to cater to IoT, yet some of the aspects are still optimized for human-to-human (H2H) communication. More specifically, the existing group paging mechanism in LTE-A Pro has not yet clearly defined approaches to group, mobile IoT devices (MIDs) having diverse characteristics, such as discontinuous reception (DRX) and data transmission frequency (DTF) with various mobility patterns. Inappropriate grouping of MIDs may lead to increased energy consumption and degraded quality of service, especially in terms of packet arrival delay (PAD) and packet loss rate (PLR). Therefore, in this paper, we devise novel models to estimate PAD, PLR, and energy consumption for MIDs, specifically for the group paging mechanism. Based on the proposed models, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective to minimize energy consumption of MIDs, while providing required PAD and PLR. The nonlinear convex optimization problem addressed herein is solved using the Lagrangian approach, and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions have been applied to derive optimal characteristics for MIDs to join the group, namely, DRX and DTF. The extensive numerical results presented verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the mathematical models demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over random grouping approach concerning significant energy consumption of MIDs.},

LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) has been standardized for the fourth-generation mobile communications to meet the growing demands for high-speed wireless communications. However, high-speed signal processing on LTE/LTE-A user equipment (UE) causes excessive power consumption. The discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism is a critical technique for tackling this issue. Delay constraint and power savings are two contradictory performance metrics associated with the DRX mechanism. Using recursive deduction and Markov model, this paper provides an in-depth analysis on the average delay and average power consumption of the DRX mechanism. Two performance metrics, namely, power-saving factor and relative power saving, are devised to assess the power-saving performance of the DRX mechanism. The accuracy of theoretical analysis is validated by computer simulations using the parameters in compliance with LTE specifications. The performance of the DRX mechanism is governed by a set of parameters that interact with one another in an intricate manner. Therefore, the values of key parameters are tested to assess their impacts on the performance of the DRX mechanism. The results shown in this paper give an insight into the operation and further improvement of the DRX mechanism.},

User Equipment (UE) power saving enhancements are at the forefront of ongoing discussions in 3GPP for next generation radio standards. Idle mode Discontinuous Reception (IDRX) is an important mechanism for UE’s power saving. However, IDRX in 5G/B5G networks is more challenging than in legacy networks. UE is required to measure Synchronization Signal Block(s) (SSBs) for Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and Physical Downlink Common Control Channel (PDCCH) reception in every paging occasion (PO) of IDRX cycle in 5G/B5G networks. Furthermore, PDSCH decoding is very sensitive to the time-frequency synchronization error and requires multiple SSB measurements before every PO. In this paper we present an Enhanced Paging Monitoring (EPM) for reducing the impediments on IDRX in 5G/B5G due to SSB measurements and related overheads. We also extend our EPM proposal by incorporating paging early indication. The proposed EPM can manifest up to 37\% more power saving compared to existing system while considering multiple SSB measurements that are essential to 5G/B5G networks.},

Therefore, an optimization is needed to find the best tradeoff between latency and power saving. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to estimate power saving achieved and latency incurred by DRX mechanism for active and background mobile traffic. A tradeoff scheme is then formulated to maintain a balance between these two performance parameters based on operator's preference for power saving and latency requirement of traffic. The analytical model is validated using system level simulation results obtained from OPNET Modeler. The results show that the proposed tradeoff scheme is efficient in keeping a balance between power saving and latency. The results also indicate that DRX short cycles are very effective in reducing latency for active traffic, while shorter inactivity timer is desirable for background traffic to enhance power saving. We also proposed a mechanism to switch DRX configuration based on traffic running at UE, using UE assistance procedure recently adopted by 3GPP in Release 11. DRX configuration switching increases the power saving significantly without any noticeable increase in latency of active traffic.},

At the same time, XR devices needs to minimize power consumption to extend battery lifetime and limit dissipated heat. Addressing capacity and latency requirements without excessively increasing power consumption of user devices requires the evolution of 5G power saving schemes. In this work, we propose an Adaptive DRX (ADRX) scheme and design a control policy to optimally adjust active duration of the DRX cycle in order to satisfy XR requirements and minimize energy consumption. To this end, we formulate the problem of selecting the user active time as a stochastic online optimization problem and present a control policy to optimally solve it. Numerical results confirm that the proposed solution increases the number of satisfied users and reduce power consumption compared to standard DRX mechanism. In particular, in a Dense Urban scenario where standard DRX cannot fulfill the requirements of any XR user, ADRX can serve up to 4-5 users per cell with 10\% power saving gain.},

	abstract = {In the next generation (5G) new radio (NR) systems, beamforming is an enabling technology for millimeter wave communications which require beam sweeping for transmission. When user equipment (UE) uses discontinuous reception (DRX) to save power, the UE may be informed of incoming services or updating system information through a paging procedure. A next generation NodeB (gNB) transmits the same paging message on multiple beams in discrete time slots to notify the target UE. As the paging is transmitted through beam sweeping, paging transmission occupies multiple time slots and the resources in paging occasion. Additionally, increasing number of time slots make the UE wake up longer to monitor the paging occasion, and this directly increases the power consumption of the UE. In this paper, we propose an efficient beam sweeping paging mechanism taking beam sweeping overhead and UE power consumption into consideration. Mathematical analysis and simulation experiments show that the proposed mechanism enhances the performance of power saving while reducing the overhead of paging sweeping beams.},

This technology has already been deployed and has proved to be ultra-efficient for point-to-point communications in terms of power-efficiency, and coverage area. This paper introduces this technology and gives some insights on the scalability of UNB for a multi-point to point network. In particular, we present a new multiple access scheme: random frequency division multiple access (R-FDMA) and study the impact of the induced interference on the system performance in terms of bit error rate and outage probability. To this aim, we propose and design a simplified model to describe the interference impact. Thanks to this model, we theoretically derive BER and OP expressions for the lower, approximated and upper case. This enables us to evaluate the performance capacity, by determining the maximum number of simultaneous users that can be served.},

	abstract = {Low power wide area (LPWA) networks are attracting a lot of attention primarily because of their ability to offer affordable connectivity to the low-power devices distributed over very large geographical areas. In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

Although some technologies follow a `make once, fit all' approach, others are designed for specific applications such as smart-metering where the devices are often stationary with low jitter and throughput requirements. ETSI is already working towards a new standard for such applications, having specified a Specification Group to study what they call Low Throughput Networks (LTN) and propose a communications standard. In the meantime industrial solutions have entered the market such as, among others, Sigfox's and OnRamp Wireless technologies and LoRaWAN. Although this may lead to fragmentation of the IoT, they are worth examining to gain insights from their innovations and approaches to solving problems that are common in IoT technologies, and more specifically, security, energy management and resource constrains. This paper examines the wireless technologies of LoRaWan, Sigfox and OnRamp Wireless, the emerging leaders in IoT smart metering applications. These have so far not been studied in any peer-reviewed paper. Furthermore we discuss the suitability of Low Throughput Networks for certain applications and how the above technologies would work in such scenarios.},

Although LPWANs are already widely deployed the performance under real-life conditions of the communication system such as Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) radio technology has not been deeply studied yet. Smart City applications of IoT imply low energy consumption, high spectrum efficiency, and comprehensive security hence the range limits are very constrained and must be verified before deployment is started. In this work, authors verify UNB technology called SIGFOX and identify technological constraints. These constraints allow us to formulate a measurement methodology combining range measurements in an urban area to show transmission characteristics of SIGFOX technology. The subsequent evaluation of the technology using reference/commercially available SIGFOX hardware in real urban areas shows the impacts to possible applications of this novel UNB technology.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the current decade has led to the development of a multitude of new access technologies targeted at low-power, wide area networks (LP-WANs). However, this has also created another challenge pertaining to technology selection. This paper reviews the performance of LP-WAN technologies for IoT, including design choices and their implications. We consider Sigfox, LoRaWAN, WavIoT, random phase multiple access (RPMA), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), as well as LTE-M and assess their performance in terms of signal propagation, coverage and energy conservation. The comparative analyses presented in this paper are based on available data sheets and simulation results. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate network performance in response to variations in system design parameters. Results show that each of RPMA, NB-IoT, and LTE-M incurs at least 9 dB additional path loss relative to Sigfox and LoRaWAN. This paper further reveals that with a 10\% improvement in receiver sensitivity, NB-IoT 882 MHz and LoRaWAN can increase coverage by up to 398\% and 142\%, respectively, without adverse effects on the energy requirements. Finally, extreme weather conditions can significantly reduce the active network life of LP-WANs. In particular, the results indicate that operating an IoT device in a temperature of -20 °C can shorten its life by about half; 53\% (WavIoT, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, and RPMA) and 48\% in LTE-M compared with environmental temperature of 40 °C.},

The current demand for machine-type communications (MTC) has resulted in a variety of communication technologies with diverse service requirements to achieve the modern IoT vision. More recent cellular standards like long-term evolution (LTE) have been introduced for mobile devices but are not well suited for low-power and low data rate devices such as the IoT devices. To address this, there is a number of emerging IoT standards. Fifth generation (5G) mobile network, in particular, aims to address the limitations of previous cellular standards and be a potential key enabler for future IoT. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of the IoT application requirements along with their associated communication technologies are surveyed. In addition, the third generation partnership project cellular-based low-power wide area solutions to support and enable the new service requirements for Massive to Critical IoT use cases are discussed in detail, including extended coverage global system for mobile communications for the Internet of Things, enhanced machine-type communications, and narrowband-Internet of Things. Furthermore, 5G new radio enhancements for new service requirements and enabling technologies for the IoT are introduced. This paper presents a comprehensive review related to emerging and enabling technologies with main focus on 5G mobile networks that is envisaged to support the exponential traffic growth for enabling the IoT. The challenges and open research directions pertinent to the deployment of massive to critical IoT applications are also presented in coming up with an efficient context-aware congestion control mechanism.},

	abstract = {Cellular networks have been engineered and optimized to carrying ever-increasing amounts of mobile data, but over the last few years, a new class of applications based on machine-centric communications has begun to emerge. Automated devices such as sensors, tracking devices, and meters, often referred to as machine-to-machine (M2M) or machine-type communications (MTC), introduce an attractive revenue stream for mobile network operators, if a massive number of them can be efficiently supported. The novel technical challenges posed by MTC applications include increased overhead and control signaling as well as diverse application-specific constraints such as ultra-low complexity, extreme energy efficiency, critical timing, and continuous data intensive uploading. This article explains the new requirements and challenges that large-scale MTC applications introduce, and provides a survey of key techniques for overcoming them. We focus on the potential of 4.5G and 5G networks to serve both the high data rate needs of conventional human-type communication (HTC) subscribers and the forecasted billions of new MTC devices. We also opine on attractive economic models that will enable this new class of cellular subscribers to grow to its full potential.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced 5G New Radio is the first wireless standard natively designed to support critical and massive machine type communications (MTC). However, it is already becoming evident that some of the more demanding requirements for MTC cannot be fully supported by 5G networks. Alongside, emerging use cases and applications towards 2030 will give rise to new and more stringent requirements on wireless connectivity in general and MTC in particular. Next generation wireless networks, namely 6G, should therefore be an agile and efficient convergent network designed to meet the diverse and challenging requirements anticipated by 2030. This paper explores the main drivers and requirements of MTC towards 6G, and discusses a wide variety of enabling technologies. More specifically, we first explore the emerging key performance indicators for MTC in 6G. Thereafter, we present a vision for an MTC-optimized holistic end-to-end network architecture. Finally, key enablers towards (1) ultra-low power MTC, (2) massively scalable global connectivity, (3) critical and dependable MTC, and (4) security and privacy preserving schemes for MTC are detailed. Our main objective is to present a set of research directions considering different aspects for an MTC-optimized 6G network in the 2030-era.},

This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative study of these technologies, which serve as efficient solutions to connect smart, autonomous, and heterogeneous devices. We show that Sigfox and LoRa are advantageous in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. Meanwhile, NB-IoT offers benefits in terms of latency and quality of service.

The fundamentals of wireless communication and all the non-trivial interests associated with these three layers are summarized with respect to the criteria imposed by IoT. Various security threats at these layers and vulnerabilities of the standards against such attacks have also been listed out. To mitigate these problems, instead of relying on any one particular solution, more emphasis is given on the integrated approach where layer-wise solutions are provided. Thereafter, a brief analysis of the available wireless communication standards and their salient features are discussed. Research scope and challenges in IoT applications ranging from low power, low data rate, short range to extended coverage are identified, followed by possible directions to be taken.

A huge amount of cost-effective passive components are included in RISs to interact with the impinging electromagnetic waves in a smart way. However, there are still some challenges in RIS system, such as finding the optimal configurations for a large number of RIS components. In this paper, we first provide a complete outline of the advancement of RISs along with machine learning (ML) algorithms and overview the working regulations as well as spectrum allocation in intelligent IoT systems. Also, we discuss the integration of different ML techniques in the context of RIS, including deep reinforcement learning (DRL), federated learning (FL), and FL-deep deterministic policy gradient (FL-DDPG) techniques which are utilized to design the radio propagation atmosphere without using pilot signals or channel state information (CSI). Additionally, in dynamic intelligent IoT networks, the application of existing integrated ML solutions to technical issues like user movement and random variations of wireless channels are surveyed.

NB-IoT targets on supporting communications for small amount of data during a relatively long period of time (i.e., delay tolerant), which is one of the key features of IoT applications. Several studies have been conducted by some standard working groups to define the standards for NB-IoT. For example, the working group 3GPP aims to provide communication protocols with low energy consumption, good coverage penetration, and so on. Compared with the existing wireless communication protocols, less spectrum is allocated for NB-IoT. Thus, how to more efficiently use the resource/spectrum (i.e., resource allocation and scheduling) is one of the key issues. In this paper, we first describe the design of the physical layer for the downlink communication, especially the scheduling process. Secondly, we discuss the issues for resource allocation in NB-IoT while the delay requirement in the physical layer is satisfied. Thirdly, we discuss the open questions and possible solutions.},

Comparing with the legacy human-centric applications, machine type communication scenarios exhibit totally different characteristics, such as low throughput, delay insensitivity, occasional transmission, and deep coverage. Meanwhile, it also requires the terminal devices to be cheap enough and sustain long battery life. These demands hasten the prosperity of low power wide area (LPWA) technologies. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is the newest Long Term Evolution (LTE) specification ratified by the third generation partner project as one of the LPWA solutions to achieve the objectives of super coverage, low power, low cost, and massive connection. Working in the licensed frequency band, it is designed to reuse and coexist with the existing LTE cellular networks, which endows it with outstanding advantages in decreasing network installation cost and minimizing product time-to-market. In this backdrop, it has been extensively regarded as one of the most promising technologies toward the IoT landscape. However, as a new LTE standard, there are still a lot of challenges that need to overcome. This paper surveys its evolutions, technologies, and issues, spanning from performance analysis, design optimization, combination with other leading technologies, to implementation and application.

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of sensors, machines, vehicles, drones, and robots will be connected, making the world around us smarter. The IoT will encompass devices that must wirelessly communicate a diverse set of data gathered from the environment for myriad new applications. The ultimate goal is to extract insights from this data and develop solutions that improve quality of life and generate new revenue. Providing large-scale, long-lasting, reliable, and near real-time connectivity is the major challenge in enabling a smart connected world. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on existing and emerging communication solutions for serving IoT applications in the context of cellular, wide-area, as well as non-terrestrial networks. Specifically, wireless technology enhancements for providing IoT access in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, and communication networks over the unlicensed spectrum are presented. Aligned with the main key performance indicators of 5G and beyond 5G networks, we investigate solutions and standards that enable energy efficiency, reliability, low latency, and scalability (connection density) of current and future IoT networks. The solutions include grant-free access and channel coding for short-packet communications, non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence. Further, a vision of new paradigm shifts in communication networks in the 2030s is provided, and the integration of the associated new technologies like artificial intelligence, non-terrestrial networks, and new spectra is elaborated. In particular, the potential of using emerging deep learning and federated learning techniques for enhancing the efficiency and security of IoT communication are discussed, and their promises and challenges are introduced. Finally, future research directions toward beyond 5G IoT networks are pointed out.},

Second, visions of 6G are provided in terms of core technical requirements, use cases, and trends. Third, a new network architecture provided by 6G to enable massive IoT is introduced, i.e., space-air-ground-underwater/sea networks enhanced by edge computing.

	abstract = {The Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has been introduced in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Rel-13 with the aim to provide low-cost, low-power, wide-area cellular connectivity for the Internet of Things. With the exponentially increasing number of connected wireless devices in the order of 100 billion, it has become crucial that researchers develop efficient resource management techniques to meet the 5th Generation (5G) quality of service (QoS) requirements. Recently, several research challenges including the low modulation data rates, energy-expensive channel coding techniques, and the fast-growing number of connected devices have been identified as some of the main issues encountered in the design and deployment of NB-IoT systems. In addition, several techniques have emerged in the literature to resolve some of these challenges of NB-IoT systems. However, the research activities towards the enhancement of the NB-IoT resource management are yet to continue in the next half-decade before, high data rates, energy-efficient, and scalable NB-IoT specifications can be released for the standardisation and commercialisation. Considering the limited number of existing surveys of such technical enhancement approaches in a broader perspective (i.e. energy efficiency, data rate performance and scalability) and also the non-existence, to the best of our knowledge, of a comparative survey, this paper seeks to elaborate, describe and compare the performances of such resources management approaches. Of the multiple NB-IoT resources, the focus of this paper is on the data rate, energy efficiency, and scalability enhancement schemes that have been proposed for the last three years. The contribution of the paper lies in the analysis, synthesis, comparison and summarised alignments of some of the major existing schemes towards identifying challenges faced by the NB-IoT development. Finally, this work seeks to identify research challenges, open questions, and opportunities that could arise from the existing techniques analysed.},

	abstract = {Energy efficiency is critical for future sustainable cellular systems. Power saving optimization has been a key part of the fifth generation (5G) new radio specifications. For 5G-advanced and future 6G, with the anticipation of a trillion internet of things (IoTs) devices with non-rechargeable or low-density batteries, device power efficiency is rather essential. There are numerous contributions from industry and academia which present the potential power saving gains of the various 5G power saving techniques; however, there is a lack of art on the performance cost paid to achieve such power saving gains. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the radio latency and reliability cost, which is lost due to a certain 5G new radio power saving feature. A thorough review of the state-of-the-art 5G power saving techniques is introduced. Extensive system level simulations are performed to evaluate the latency and reliability cost of the considered power saving features. The paper offers valuable recommendations for supporting power-efficient latency-critical traffic for beyond 5G-advanced systems.},

It can be applied for UEs under “low mobility” and “cell edge” criteria. In this study, we investigate its benefit in addition to discontinuous reception (DRX) for reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR) UEs, a new type of low-cost device, for which the power saving is a key requirement. We provide comprehensive simulation results that quantify energy saving by applying RRM relaxation for stationary and pedestrian RedCap UEs with different “cell edge” criteria and DRX settings. In addition, we evaluate the impact in terms of handover failures and packet delay. The simulation analysis shows that dynamic adjustment of “cell edge” criteria of RRM relaxation is a more power-efficient solution that can achieve up to 64\% to 96\% RRM measurement energy saving.},

Nevertheless, there are a few other use cases that are in-between these main use cases such as industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance, or wearables. In order to efficiently serve such use cases, in Release 17, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) introduced the reduced capability NR devices (NR-RedCap) with lower cost and complexity, smaller form factor, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. However, one key potential consequence of device cost and complexity reduction is coverage loss. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of NR RedCap coverage for different physical channels and initial access messages to identify the channels/messages that are potentially coverage limiting for RedCap UEs. We perform the coverage evaluations for RedCap UEs operating in three different scenarios, namely Rural, Urban and Indoor with carrier frequencies 0.7 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 28 GHz, respectively. Our results confirm that for all the considered scenarios, the amounts of required coverage recovery for RedCap channels are either less than 1 dB or can be compensated by considering smaller data rate targets for RedCap use cases.},

This work attempts to identify, categorize, and analyze the available literature on this problem.

NB-IoT targets on supporting communications for small amount of data during a relatively long period of time (i.e., delay tolerant), which is one of the key features of IoT applications. Several studies have been conducted by some standard working groups to define the standards for NB-IoT. For example, the working group 3GPP aims to provide communication protocols with low energy consumption, good coverage penetration, and so on. Compared with the existing wireless communication protocols, less spectrum is allocated for NB-IoT. Thus, how to more efficiently use the resource/spectrum (i.e., resource allocation and scheduling) is one of the key issues. In this paper, we first describe the design of the physical layer for the downlink communication, especially the scheduling process. Secondly, we discuss the issues for resource allocation in NB-IoT while the delay requirement in the physical layer is satisfied. Thirdly, we discuss the open questions and possible solutions.},

Comparing with the legacy human-centric applications, machine type communication scenarios exhibit totally different characteristics, such as low throughput, delay insensitivity, occasional transmission, and deep coverage. Meanwhile, it also requires the terminal devices to be cheap enough and sustain long battery life. These demands hasten the prosperity of low power wide area (LPWA) technologies. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is the newest Long Term Evolution (LTE) specification ratified by the third generation partner project as one of the LPWA solutions to achieve the objectives of super coverage, low power, low cost, and massive connection. Working in the licensed frequency band, it is designed to reuse and coexist with the existing LTE cellular networks, which endows it with outstanding advantages in decreasing network installation cost and minimizing product time-to-market. In this backdrop, it has been extensively regarded as one of the most promising technologies toward the IoT landscape. However, as a new LTE standard, there are still a lot of challenges that need to overcome. This paper surveys its evolutions, technologies, and issues, spanning from performance analysis, design optimization, combination with other leading technologies, to implementation and application. The goal is to deliver a holistic understanding for the emerging wireless communication system, in helping to spur further research in accelerating the broad use of NB-IoT.},

These infrastructures involve multiple devices that utilize different communication technologies to increase the overall operational efficiency. Rooting from the key implementation requirements of a smart factory environment, this article focuses on the role of cellular connectivity and wearable technology in enabling new industrial applications. Specifically, we shed light on a novel category of services - industrial mid-end wearable applications - by positioning their requirements among the 5G service classes. We then identify features that can complement cellular connectivity to further support the given requirements. More precisely, we review cellu-lar-network-aided device-to-device communications and reduced-capability devices. Our performance evaluation results justify the choice of these features and show that they can work in concert with cellular connectivity to enhance spectral efficiency and reliability in industrial mid-end wearable applications.},

This research aims to find appropriate EDC systems for the Personal Health Train (PHT). This platform enables organizations and researchers to work with health data from diverse sources without sharing these data. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the system is prepared for privacy and security regulations. Due to the diversity of privacy regulations worldwide, this research investigates whether the EDC systems comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This paper presents a short review of the PHT concept, the role of the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, potential risks, protection measures for hospital information systems. In our evaluation, we provided an overview of five EDC systems: Castor, OpenClinica, REDCap, NowEDC, and ShareCRF. We evaluated their security and privacy features and techniques to store data. A comparison of their features is given, and a preliminary usability test is presented.},

To meet such contrasting requirements, 5G networks rely on its new radio interface (5G-NR) to address eMBB and URLLC services and on LTE-M and NB-IoT for mMTC services. As of Release 16, 5G networks effectively support the extreme ends of key performance indicators, namely bandwidth, reliability, latency, coverage, and autonomy.

This leads to high application variability of IoT devices and therefore poses a challenge for the implementation of channel estimation (CE), especially under weak radio signal conditions. However, due to the computational complexity of optimal methods, practical suboptimal approaches with denoising capability are preferred in low-power devices. This work investigates the performance and implementation aspects of practical IoT CE denoising techniques on a vector digital signal processor (vDSP). This solution enables adaptation to the new IoT workload requirements with a 15.9x speed-up compared to the non-vectorised approach at 99.2\% processor efficiency. In addition, for the purpose of solution adaptation to various IoT standards, the clock frequency requirements for the complete channel estimation chain are analysed with respect to different processor configurations.},

	abstract = {3GPP Release 16 describes two UE criteria for radio resource management (RRM) relaxation, ‘low mobility’ and ‘not at the cell edge’. This work presents a simulation analysis of RRM relaxation for reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR) UEs. Two categories are simulated, namely ‘low mobility’ and ‘low mobility + not at the cell edge’ to find the most suitable relaxation criteria for the RRC-Connected state. This work quantifies the energy savings that RRM relaxation brings for stationary and low mobility RedCap UEs with different relaxation intervals varied from 40 ms to 5120 ms. Furthermore, it identifies the cost of energy-saving in terms of radio link failures and handover failures. The simulation analysis shows that the ‘low mobility + not at the cell edge’ criteria is the most suitable for RedCap UEs in comparison to only ‘low mobility’ criteria. Also, high relaxation interval (i.e. 5120 ms) is suitable up to pedestrian UEs speeds.},

	abstract = {The fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology is primarily designed to address a wide range of use cases categorized into the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine-type communication (mMTC). Nevertheless, there are a few other use cases that are in-between these main use cases such as industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance, or wearables. In order to efficiently serve such use cases, in Release 17, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) introduced the reduced capability NR devices (NR-RedCap) with lower cost and complexity, smaller form factor, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. However, one key potential consequence of device cost and complexity reduction is coverage loss. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of NR RedCap coverage for different physical channels and initial access messages to identify the channels/messages that are potentially coverage limiting for RedCap UEs. We perform the coverage evaluations for RedCap UEs operating in three different scenarios, namely Rural, Urban and Indoor with carrier frequencies 0.7 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 28 GHz, respectively. Our results confirm that for all the considered scenarios, the amounts of required coverage recovery for RedCap channels are either less than 1 dB or can be compensated by considering smaller data rate targets for RedCap use cases.},

Smart factories rely primarily on wireless connectivity provided by new radio (NR) systems to meet the stringent requirements of industrial applications. Among these, several industrial wearable and sensor-based services involve devices with relaxed communication capabilities as compared to Rel-15 NR user equipment. Hence, a new category of reduced-capability (RedCap) devices becomes essential in industrial private networks. As RedCap devices may experience degradation of uplink (UL) performance due to simplifications in radio frequency and baseband capabilities, this paper focuses on enhancing NR RedCap operations with existing 5G solutions for UL improvement, namely, dual connectivity, carrier aggregation, and supplementary UL. Specifically, we discuss these options for RedCap wearable devices and evaluate the performance gains of the selected technology using link-level simulations.},

It enables UEs in RRC Inactive state to transmit infrequent and small data without requiring an RRC state transition. In this paper, we study the envisioned SDT solutions, namely RACH-based SDT and CG-based SDT. We evaluate their performance in terms of packet delay, UE power consumption, signaling overhead and physical resource efficiency. Results show that all SDT solutions bring attractive gains as compared to the conventional data transfer after the RRC connection resume. Particularly, CG-based SDT solution achieves the highest gains with 73\% in UE power efficiency and 85\% in latency reduction. It enables to reduce the signaling overhead and to save the physical resource usage by 78\%. We further analyse the performance sensitivity to the payload size, the traffic arrival rate and the UE mobility pattern.},

As a result, eMTC and NB-IoT are mature 4G wireless technologies that are seeing largescale deployment. Thus, even as 4G systems migrate to 5G New Radio (NR) technology, there is a strong motivation to continue to support eMTC devices through efficient deployment of eMTC within a 5G NR carrier. In 3GPP, studies are underway to identify and rectify issues related to coexistence between eMTC and NR systems. This paper presents an analysis of such coexistence considering various aspects. The analysis demonstrates that the issues affecting coexistence can generally be handled through implementation. The paper also discusses several mechanisms for achieving improved performance with coexistence.},

	abstract = {Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) does not support data transmission during random access (RA) procedures, which results in unnecessary control signalling overhead and power consumption, especially for small data transmission (SDT). Motivated by this, 3GPP has proposed 4/2-step SDT RA schemes based on the existing grant-based (4-step) and grant-free (2-step) RA schemes, with the aim to enable data transmission during RA procedures in Radio Resource Control (RRC) Inactive state. To compare the 4/2-step SDT RA schemes with the benchmark 4/2-step RA schemes, we provide a spatio-temporal analytical framework to evaluate the RA schemes, which jointly models the preamble detection, Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) decoding, and data transmission procedures. Based on this analytical model, we derive the analytical expressions for the overall packet transmission success probability and average throughput in each RACH attempt. We also derive the average energy consumption in each RACH attempt. Our results show that 2-step SDT RA scheme provides the highest overall packet transmission success probability, and the lowest average energy consumption, but the performance gain decreases with the increase of device intensity.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, many disruptive Internet of things (IoT) applications emerge, such as augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) online games, autonomous driving, and smart everything, which are massive in number, data-intensive, computation-intensive, and delay-sensitive. Due to the mismatch between the ﬁfth generation (5G) and the requirements of such massive IoT-enabled applications, there is a need for technological advancements and evolutions for wireless communications and networking toward the sixth generation (6G) networks. 6G is expected to deliver extended 5G capabilities at a very high level, such as Tbps data rate, sub-ms latency, cm-level localization, and so on, which will play a signiﬁcant role in supporting massive IoT devices to operate seamlessly with highly diverse service requirements. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on 6G-enabled massive IoT. First, we present the drivers and requirements by summarizing the emerging IoT-enabled applications and the corresponding requirements, along with the limitations of 5G. Second, visions of 6G are provided in terms of core technical requirements, use cases, and trends. Third, a new network architecture provided by 6G to enable massive IoT is introduced, i.e., space-air-groundunderwater/sea networks enhanced by edge computing. Fourth, some breakthrough technologies, such as machine learning and blockchain, in 6G are introduced, where the motivations, applications, and open issues of these technologies for massive IoT are summarized. At last, a use case of fully autonomous driving is presented to show 6G supports massive IoT.},

	abstract = {5th generation (5G) systems have been designed with three main objectives in mind: increasing throughput, reducing latency, and enabling reliable communications. To meet these (often conflicting) constraints, in 2019 the 3GPP released a set of specifications for 5G NR, one of the main innovations being the support for communications in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. However, how to implement lower complexity, energy efficient, mid-market Internet of Things (IoT) applications is still an on-going investigation, currently led by the 3GPP which is extending the NR standard with NR-Light specifications to support devices with reduced capabilities (REDCAP). In this paper we investigate the feasibility of operating such devices at mmWaves, in view of the requirements and expectations for NR- Light applications in terms of cost and complexity, throughput, and latency. Contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we il- lustrate the potential of mmWave communication for mid-market IoT use cases. Then, we highlight and motivate the design of an NR-Light candidate interface derived from NR by a selection of features. Finally, we demonstrate the technical soundness of this interface in an industrial IoT setup via simulations.},

This leads to high application variability of IoT devices and therefore poses a challenge for the implementation of channel estimation (CE), especially under weak radio signal conditions. However, due to the computational complexity of optimal methods, practical suboptimal approaches with denoising capability are preferred in low-power devices. This work investigates the performance and implementation aspects of practical IoT CE denoising techniques on a vector digital signal processor (vDSP). This solution enables adaptation to the new IoT workload requirements with a 15.9x speed-up compared to the non-vectorised approach at 99.2\% processor efficiency. In addition, for the purpose of solution adaptation to various IoT standards, the clock frequency requirements for the complete channel estimation chain are analysed with respect to different processor configurations.},

Nevertheless, there are a few other use cases that are in-between these main use cases such as industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance, or wearables. In order to efﬁciently serve such use cases, in Release 17, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) introduced the reduced capability NR devices (NR-RedCap) with lower cost and complexity, smaller form factor, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. However, one key potential consequence of device cost and complexity reduction is coverage loss. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of NR RedCap coverage for different physical channels and initial access messages to identify the channels/messages that are potentially coverage limiting for RedCap UEs. We perform the coverage evaluations for RedCap UEs operating in three different scenarios, namely Rural, Urban and Indoor with carrier frequencies 0.7 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 28 GHz, respectively. Our results conﬁrm that for all the considered scenarios, the amounts of required coverage recovery for RedCap channels are either less than 1 dB or can be compensated by considering smaller data rate targets for RedCap use cases.},
